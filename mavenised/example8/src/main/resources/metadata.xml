      -- This meta-data file instructs the Service Binder to
      -- create one instance of "SpellCheckerImpl". It also
      -- tells the generic activator that this instance implements the
      -- "SpellChecker" service interface and that it has an
      -- aggregate dependency on "DictionaryService" services. Since
      -- the service dependency on dictionary services has a lower
      -- cardinality of one, the generic activator will create the instance
      -- and offer its spell checker service only when there is at least
      -- one dictionary service available. The service dependency is
      -- "dynamic", which means that dictionary service availability
      -- will be monitored dynamically at runtime and it also tells the
      -- generic activator which methods to call when adding and removing
      -- dictionary services.
